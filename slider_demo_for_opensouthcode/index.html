      Save the clock tower. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Marty. Marty. Marty. Jesus, you smoke too?
    </p>
    <p>
      George, help me, please. Ah, where're my pants? Uh, Doc. Quiet. Stop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? Yeah. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Ah.
    </p>
    <p>      
      Yeah, it's 8:00. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. What you got under here? What did your mother ever see in that kid? Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl.
    </p>
    <p>      
      Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship?
    </p>
    <p>      
      This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Save the clock tower. Do you mind if we park for a while? I'm gonna be at the dance. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa?
    </p>
    <p>      
      Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. George. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her.
    </p>
    <p>      
      Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. Children. Ahh. I think we need a rematch. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.
    </p>
    <p>      
      whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. You got a permit for that? See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. About how far ahead are you going? Take care.
    </p>
    <p>      
      George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. Flux capacitor. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Yeah.
